# CS420X A3
# Assignment 3 - Reaction Diffusion (simulation #1)


For A3, I played around with the reaction diffusion through the reds and greens. I played around with how the new A and B values could interact with one another. It also took me awhile to figure out the number scale for each of the variables I should give the user. Initially I wanted multiple overlapping colors, but it took me a lot longer to get the simulation working like I wanted it to. Because of this I stuck with reds and greens. 

I unfortunately wasn't able to get any feedback because I am completing this assignment over the spring break. Due to my mental health this past term, I did not have the ability to complete the assignment. Even though I am doing this after the term, I am still very pleased with what I made.
